# my_functions
i created this Repository to keep functions that could be usefull in other projects during my learning cursus.

##the functions :
1 ==> revers_bytes :
    PROTOTYPE : sigset_t	reverse_nbr_bytes(sigset_t set, int numbytes);
      set      : the decimal number of the char(even the unicode) you want to revers .
      numbytes : the needed bytes to present that char 
    >> NOTE : this function used to revers the bytes of characteres that need more than one byte (8 bits) to be represented .
